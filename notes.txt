First we have to install node, tailwind
app.ts jo file hai wo compile hone ke baad app.js mai convert hogi
tsc --watch -> TO check errors in realtime


Data Types in tailwind
1. Number
2. Character
3. String
4. Boolean

var
let
const

Primitive and Reference

Primitive Types = Number, Character, String, Boolean

Reference -> [] {} ()

let arr = [] -> Square bracket means array
The differnece of array in js and ts is that we can only pass simliar set of data in array. like for example in one array we cannot and number and string both, but in javascript we can do this


let arr: number[] = [1,2,3,4] -> in this array now we can only pass numbers, when passed strings in will throw an error althogh it will compile

What are tuples?
in tuple we have to predefined what data we are passing in array, tuple means fixed

let arr:[String, Number] = ["Air", 10]

What are enums?
-> Enumerations, simliar to objects key value pair but instead of : we should use = ex are as follows
enum userRoles{
    ADMIN = "admin",
    GUEST = "guest",
    SUPERADMIN = "superadmin",
}

userRoles.ADMIN

enum statusCodes {
    ABANDOND = "abandonded status code 500",
    NOTFOUND = "Status code not found"
}

statusCodes.NOTFOUND
